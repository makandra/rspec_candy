Changes from previous versions:

- `new_and_store` has been renamed `create_without_callbacks`
- `keep_invalid!` has been renamed to `prevent_storage`
- `Object#should_not_receive_and_execute` has been removed (same as `Object#should_not_receive`)
- `should_receive_all_with` (over-generic method name for a helper that is rarely useful)
